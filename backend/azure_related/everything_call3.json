We took took a look at some of the progress. We took a look at some of the limitations that you've had. I think some of the things you mentioned where you weren't able to work on the oven and do some of the repairs. You also have some challenges with raising your arm up above."

So I think you mentioned something along the lines of playing soccer. You're back to playing about 90% of those games and while there is a little bit of pain, you're able to go through all of it. So reviewing all the information there at this point, it doesn't look like we can approve further treatment for your physiotherapy. What we can do and and offer is."
